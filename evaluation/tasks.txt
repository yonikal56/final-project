Tests ideas:
general -
1. x|y and y|z => x|z
2. random number of x, random number of const, random number of asserts - random of each size and random - =/!=
operators -
1. exists n different numbers with the same prime factors
2. exists n different numbers with the same number prime factors
3. exists 2 numbers with the same gcd and not lcm
4. 2 equal number with different number of prime factors - unsat


Nelson-OpPen - add support of +, -, and >=,<=,>,< - convert sides to bag.to.int. grep "QF_NIA"

Other operations ideas from BAG kinds
