Guide points:
- add expected
- set option for the pass in all test automatically

Tests ideas:
1. multiplication of n >= 2 integers is some value - sat
2. like 1 but all different from the result and 1
3. like 2 but all different from each other
4. like 1 but for a prime number
5. like 2 but for a prime number

more:
1. multiplication of 2/more variables equals to one of them
2. the same but with the others different from the result
3. x|y and y|z => x|z


TODO:
-x|y and y|z => x|z


1. exists n different numbers with the same prime factors
2. exists n different numbers with the same number prime factors
3. exists 2 numbers with the same gcd and not lcm
4. 2 equal number with different number of prime factors - unsat

5. random number of x, random number of const, random number of asserts - random of each size and random - =/!=

divisor - operator (other operations idea from BAG kinds - after!)



Nelson-OpPen - add support of +, -, and >=,<=,>,< - convert sides to bag.to.int. grep "QF_NIA"
Nelso-Oppen - add support to dump-models
