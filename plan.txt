Plan
-----
- dummy preprocessing
- implementation + testing of reduction to bags
- generation of many benchmarks
- Buffer for bug-fixes and performance improvements
- analysis of many benchmarks

- Nelson Oppen
- 1. add operators bti, itb
- 2. function to calculate the operators

- More Operators based on the reduction to bags - prime, equiviliance with respect to number-of-prime-factos, equivilance with respect to the same prime factos, gcd, lcm

- Submission
  - beginning of July


- integration using Nelson Oppen
- evaluation of Nelson Oppen + other tools
- analysis of Nelson Oppen
